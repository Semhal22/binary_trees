# 0x1D. C - Binary trees
## This repository includes tasks concerned with using a Treee Data Structure. The first tasks deal with using Binary Trees, Binary Trees are general trees in which the root node can only hold up to maximum 2 subtrees. Then it goes on to more complicated structures like Binary Search Tree, AVL tree and so on.
1. New node
1. Insert left
1. Insert right
1. Delete
1. Is leaf - no left and right child
1. Is root
1. Pre-order traversal - print root, left, right
1. In-order traversal - print left, root, right
1. Post-order traversal - print left, right, root
1. Height
1. Depth
1. Size
1. Leaves
